# üöÄ Ollama x Streamlit Playground

This project demonstrates how to run and manage models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) by creating an interactive UI with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

The app has a page for running chat-based models and also one for nultimodal models (_llava and bakllava_) for vision.
